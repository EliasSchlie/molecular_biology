### 🚀 Why This Project?  
🧑‍🔬 My goal is to make **aging and death completely optional**.  
🧠 To achieve that, I am building a **world-class understanding** of AI/ML and Biology.  

📖 To master the fundamentals, I’m studying one of the **most respected textbooks** in the field—**cover to cover**.  
📝 I’m publishing my **solutions to the problem sets** for every chapter in this repository.
