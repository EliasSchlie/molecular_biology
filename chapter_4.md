##### Which statements are true? Explain why or why not.

###### 4–1
Human females have 23 different chromosomes, whereas human males have 24.
→ False - Humans have 22 pairs of autosomes (independent of sex) and one pair of sex chromosomes. Males have XY and females have an XX combination. If you would count chromosome pairs (including XX) as one chromosome and the different sex chromosomes of males as 2 the statement is actually true

###### 4–2
The four core histones are relatively small proteins with a very high proportion of positively charged amino acids; the positive charge helps the histones bind tightly to DNA, regardless of its nucleotide sequence.
- While the DNA sequence makes a difference in how tight histones can bind, the positive charge of the outside of histones helps to bind regardless because of the negatively charged phosphate groups in the DNA backbone

###### 4–3
Nucleosomes bind DNA so tightly that they cannot move from the positions where they are first assembled.
- False - there are chromatin remodeling complexes that do exactly that - they slide nucleosomes along the DNA

###### 4–4
The long linear DNA molecule in an interphase chromosome is organized into loops of chromatin that appear to emanate from a central axis.
- True

###### 4–5
In a comparison between the DNAs of related organisms such as humans and mice, identifying the conserved DNA sequences facilitates the search for functionally important regions.
- True
###### 4–6
Gene duplication and divergence are thought to have played a critical role in the evolution of increased biological complexity.
- True
##### Discuss the following problems.

###### 4–7
DNA isolated from the bacterial virus M13 contains 25% A, 33% T, 22% C, and 20% G. Do these results strike you as peculiar? Why or why not? How might you explain these values?
- They are peculiar because in a double strand DNA there should be the same amount of A as T and C as G. A possible explanation of those results could be that the virus has a single strand DNA
###### 4–8
A segment of DNA from the interior of a single strand is shown in Figure Q4–1. Should this sequence be written as ACT or TCA? Why?
- TCA
###### 4–9
Human DNA contains 20% C on a molar basis. What are the mole percents of A, G, and T?
- G = 20%
- A = 30%
- T = 30%

###### 4–10
In contrast to histone acetylation, which always correlates with gene activation, histone methylation can lead to either transcriptional activation or repression. How do you suppose that the same modification—methylation—can mediate different biological outcomes?
- Methylation primarily plays a role in attracting reader proteins which in tern can attract different type of other proteins - Due to there being different types of methylation (mono, di, and tri) the space of possible proteins with different function is big enough to sometimes increase and sometimes decrease transcription

###### 4–11
Why is a chromosome with two centromeres (a dicentric chromosome) unstable? Would a backup centromere not be a good thing for a chromosome, giving it two chances to form a kinetochore and attach to microtubules during mitosis? Surely, a backup centromere would ensure that the chromosome did not get left behind at mitosis.
- If a chromosome would have multiple centromeres, there is a higher chance of something going wrong during cell division as each centromere might attach to an opposite spindle. This would lead to a tug-of-war that might break the chromosome
###### 4–12
Look at the two yeast colonies in Figure Q4–2. Each of these colonies contains about 100,000 cells descended from a single yeast cell, originally somewhere in the middle of the clump. A white colony arises when the Ade2 gene is expressed from its normal chromosomal location. When the Ade2 gene is moved near a telomere, however, it is packed into heterochromatin and inactivated in most cells, giving rise to colonies that are mostly red. In these largely red colonies, white sectors fan out from the middle of the colony. In both the red portions and the white sectors, the Ade2 gene is still located near telomeres. Explain why white sectors have formed near the rim of the red colony. On the basis of the patterns observed, what can you conclude about the propagation of the transcriptional state of the Ade2 gene from mother to daughter cells in this experiment?
- The red color appears because the heterochromatin state of the telomeres spreads to inactivate Ade2 which previously caused the white color. (position effect variegation)
- The white sections form because for some of the cells, the heterochromatin spreading over Ade2 got randomly reversed and this change gets passed on to daughter cells
- This experiment shows that the transcriptional state of Ade2 is inherited by daughter cells as white chunks probably result in one yeast re-activating Ade2 and then passing this on to its daughters (epigenetic changes are inherited)

###### 4–13
Chromosomes from different amphibians form typical lampbrush chromosomes when injected into oocytes as demembranated sperm heads. When the sperm heads from Rana pipiens (northern leopard frog), which forms large loops in its own oocyte chromosomes, were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, the resulting lampbrush chromosomes had the small loops typical of those found in X. laevis oocytes. Similarly, when the sperm heads from X. laevis were injected into Notophthalmus viridescens (red-spotted newt) oocytes, the resulting lampbrush chromosomes had the very large loop structure typical of N. viridescens. Do these heterologous injection experiments support the idea that loop structure is a fixed property of a chromosome? Why or why not?
- It doesn't support the idea because it shows that loop structure depends on the environment the chromosome is in.

###### 4–14
Mobile pieces of DNA—transposable elements—that insert themselves into chromosomes and accumulate during evolution make up more than 40% of the human genome. Transposable elements of four types—long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, and DNA transposons—are inserted more or less randomly throughout the human genome. These elements are conspicuously rare at the four homeobox gene clusters, HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD, as illustrated for HoxD in Figure Q4–3, along with an equivalent region of chromosome 22, which lacks a Hox cluster. Each Hox cluster is about 100 kilobases (kb) in length and contains 9–11 genes, whose differential expression along the anteroposterior axis of the developing embryo establishes the basic body plan for humans (and for other animals). Why do you suppose that transposable elements are so rare in the Hox clusters?
- They probably are this rare because the genes in this cluster are extremely important for survival and most changes or insertions lead to severely deleterious effects. Natural selection would therefore strongly select against transposable elements in those regions

###### 4–15
Chromosome 3 in orangutans differs from chromosome 3 in humans by two inversion events that occurred in the human lineage (Figure Q4–4). Draw the two inversions — illustrate the intermediate chromosome that resulted from the first inversion and explicitly indicate the segments included in each inversion.

###### 4–16
There has been a colossal snafu in the maternity ward at your local hospital. Four sets of male twins, born within an hour of each other, were inadvertently shuffled in the excitement occasioned by that unlikely event. You have been called in to set things right. As a first step, you want to get the twins matched up. To that end, you analyze a small blood sample from each infant using a hybridization probe that detects differences in the numbers of simple sequence repeats such as (CA)n located in widely scattered regions of the genome. The results are shown in Figure Q4–5.

A. Which infants are brothers? Are they all identical twins?  
- 1-7, 2-8, 3-6, 4-5
- All, except 4-5 are identical twins
B. How will you match brothers to the correct parents?
- I would check blood samples from the parents and match for the length of their CACA repeats
