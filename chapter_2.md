While reading the first 3 chapers, I didn't know that I would publish my answers to the xgestions, so they are less well formated. I recommend lookingt at my answers from capter 4 on, but of course, you can also check the following 😁

## which statements are true? Explain why or why not.

2–1 A 10–8 M solution of HCl has a pH of 8.
- False → more around 6?

2–2 Most of the interactions between macromolecules could be mediated just as well by covalent bonds as by noncovalent bonds.
- False - because they have different strength

2–3 Animals and plants use oxidation to extract energy from food molecules.
- True - because oxidation releases energy

2–4 If an oxidation occurs in a reaction, it must be accompanied by a reduction.
- True

2–5 Linking the energetically unfavorable reaction A → B to a second, favorable reaction B → C will shift the equilibrium constant for the first reaction.
- Partially true - It will shift the equilibrium constant of both!

2–6 The criterion for whether a reaction proceeds spontaneously is ΔG, not ΔG°, because ΔG takes into account the concentrations of the substrates and products.
- True - 𝚫G° assumes norma conditions and concentrations of 1 mole on each side, so it doesn't inform if a reaction will be spontaneous under different conditions

2–7 The oxygen consumed during the oxidation of glucose in animal cells is returned as CO2 to the atmosphere.
- False - it becomes HO2 in the mitochondria (maybe later converted to CO2 though)

##### Discuss the following problems.

2-8 During an all-out sprint, muscles produce a high concentration of lactic acid, which lowers the pH of the blood and of the cytosol. The lower pH inside the cell reduces the rate of ATP production and contributes to the fatigue that sprinters experience well before their fuel reserves are exhausted. The main blood buffer against pH changes is the bicarbonate/CO2 system.

To improve their performance, would you advise sprinters to hold their breath or to breathe rapidly just before the race? Why?

I would advise them to breath rapidly to increase the pH of their blood
- this works because rapid breathing gets rid of CO2 which then can't turn into CO3^2- and make the solution more accidic


2–9 The three molecules in Figure Q2–1 contain the seven most common functional groups in biology. Most molecules in the cell are built from these functional groups. Indicate and name the functional groups in these molecules.

2–10 The molecular weight of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) is 46 and its density is 0.789 g/cm3

A. What is the molarity of ethanol in beer that is 5%
- 5% = 50g/L
- 1 mol ethalol = 46g
- → 5% ~1mol/l

B. The legal limit for a driver’s blood alcohol content varies, but 80 mg of ethanol per 100 mL of blood (usually referred to as a blood alcohol level of 0.08) is typical. What is the molarity of ethanol in a person at this legal limit?
- 0,8g/l
- 0,8g = 1/58mol
- → 1/58mol/l


C. How many 12-oz (355-mL) bottles of 5% beer could a 70-kg person drink and remain under the legal limit? A 70-kg person contains about 40 liters of water.
Ignore the metabolism of ethanol and assume that the water content of the person remains constant and that ethanol distributes evenly in that volume.
40l * 0,8g = 32g
50cm3/l * 0,789g/cm3 = 39,45g/l
→ a bit less than 1 litter → 2,5 cans

2–11 A histidine side chain is known to play an important role in the catalytic mechanism of an enzyme; however, it is not clear whether histidine is required in its protonated (charged) or unprotonated (uncharged) state. To answer this question, you measure enzyme activity over a range of pH, with the results shown in Figure Q2–2. Which form of histidine is required for enzyme activity?
→ charged!

2–12 The organic chemistry of living cells is said to be special for two reasons: it occurs in an aqueous environ-ment, and it accomplishes some very complex reactions. But do you suppose it is really all that much different from the organic chemistry carried out in the top laboratories in the world? Why or why not?
- if the top labs don't use aqueous solutions, it's definitely very different because H2O environment changes the strength of electrostatic attractions
- Also, labs won't reach anything close to the complexity of cells anytime soon

2–13 Polymerization of tubulin subunits into microtubules occurs with an increase in the orderliness of the subunits. Yet tubulin polymerization occurs with an increase in entropy (decrease in order). How can that be?
- It's coupled with a favorable reaction


2–15 Each phosphoanhydride bond between the phosphate groups in ATP is a high-energy linkage with a ΔG° value of –30.5 kJ/mole. Hydrolysis of this bond in cells normally liberates usable energy in the range of 45 to 55 kJ/mole. Why do you think a range of values for released energy is given for ΔG, rather than a precise number, as for ΔG°?
→ Differences in the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and phosphate can significantly change ΔG.

2–16 A 70-kg adult human (154 lb) could meet his or her entire energy needs for one day by eating 3 moles of glucose (540 g). (We do not recommend this.) Each molecule of glucose generates 30 molecules of ATP when it is oxidized to CO2. The concentration of ATP is maintained in cells at about 2 mM, and a 70-kg adult has about 25 liters of intracellular fluid. Given that the ATP concentration remains constant in cells, calculate how many times per day, on average, each ATP molecule in the body is hydrolyzed and resynthesized.
- food provides 3 * 30 moles of ATP = 90moles
1. how many ATP molecules in body:
	- 0,002M/l * 25l = 0,05 moles
- 90/0,05 = 1.800 times per molecule


2–17 What is the “packet of energy” that NADH and NADPH carry? 
A hydride ion (two electrons and one proton)

2–18 Cancer cells can increase the rate of glycolysis up to 200-fold relative to normal differentiated cells. This effect, known as the Warburg effect after its discoverer, is exploited in an imaging technique that is commonly used to detect tumors. An individual is dosed with a molecule labeled with a radioactive isotope of fluorine (18F). The labeled molecule is preferentially taken up by cancer cells and is detected by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Which one of the followingmolecules would you label with 18F to detect tumors via the Warburg effect?
→ Glucose

2–19 Does a Snickers candy bar (65 g, 1360 kJ) provide enough energy to climb from Zermatt (elevation 1660 m) to the top of the Matterhorn (4478 m; Figure Q2–3), or might you need to stop at Hörnli Hut (3260 m) to eat another one? Imagine that you and your gear have a mass of 75 kg and that all of your work is done against gravity (that is, you are just climbing straight up). Remember from your introductory physics course that work (J) = mass (kg) × g (m/sec2) × height gained (m) where g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/sec2). One joule is 1 kg m2/sec2. What assumptions made here will greatly underestimate how much candy you need?

75kg * 9.8 * 2.818 = 2.071,23 ~ 2kJ
-> need to eat more 

assumes 100% efficient use of candy without heat... production

2–20 Assuming that there are 5e13 cells in the human body and that ATP is turning over at a rate of 10^9 ATP molecules per minute in each cell, how many watts is the human body consuming? Assume that hydrolysis of ATP yields 50 kJ/mole.

5 * 10^13 * 10^9 / 60 / (6,022 * 10^23) * 50000 = 69,19074505 wats
